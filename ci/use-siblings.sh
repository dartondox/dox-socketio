# CI tests this repo against the newest code of the Dox packages it uses,
# not the versions on pub.dev. So a change that needs a change in another
# Dox repo can be tested, and merged, before anything is released.
#
# For each repo in the list below, it clones github.com/dartondox/<repo>
# next to this repo (../<repo>). It takes the branch with the same name as
# this PR (or push) if that repo has one, else main. A folder that is
# already there is kept (local dev). Then it writes the root
# pubspec_overrides.yaml (gitignored, never committed or published) with
# path overrides. Run `dart pub get` after it.
#
# The list also has the Dox repos that those packages use (like
# dox-validation for dox_core). Overrides count for the whole dependency
# tree, so all Dox packages must come from the newest code, or pub may not
# resolve. Only the list is cloned, never the lists of the clones.
#
# The native packages (dox_http_native, dox_postgres_native,
# dox_mysql_native) are cloned too. `ci/use-siblings.sh build` builds their
# Rust library with cargo, only for this machine (linux x64 on CI), into
# native/target/release. Their build hook takes the library from there.
#
# On a tag (a release) it does nothing. A release tests on pub.dev only.
